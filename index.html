              <p> I am a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at <a href="https://www.dynamo.ai">Dynamo AI</a> focusing on LLM Research & GTM. I have a BA in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in machine learning from the <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu">University of California, Berkeley</a>. 
                 I am originally from John's Creek, Georgia and love playing football, basketball, volleyball, chess, and poker! My interests lie in large language models, generative AI, computer vision & deep learning research, sports analytics, and data science.

                predict steering wheel and throttle of the delivery robots by implementing the Stanford paper, <a href = 'http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/626.pdf'> <i>Self-Driving Car Steering Angle Prediction Based on Image Recognition</i></a>,
                on the data my team collected. Following the paper, I built two different models in PyTorch. The first model comprised of 3D convolutional layers followed by LSTM recurrent layers. The second model used transfer learning with 2D convolutional 
                layers on a pre-trained model where I only retrained the fully connected layers.

                detect and diagnose lung cancer from medical imagery. As the technology lead, I built the machine learning pipeline. The pipeline had two parts. The first
                part was a SSD object detection model that would return bounding boxes of tumors found in  CT scans. The second part of the pipeline was a 
                classification model that would classify whether or not the tumor found in the first part of the pipeline was benign or malignant.

              <p> I have been very interested in investement research. I have written couple of investment pitches for positions in my portfolio. Specifcally, I wrote a long thesis on NetEase and a short thesis on Nvidia. On another note, since January 2020,
                 my portfolio has beaten the S&P 500 benchmark index by 11%. Portfolio has returned 26.64%, whereas S&P 500 has returned only 15.16%.
